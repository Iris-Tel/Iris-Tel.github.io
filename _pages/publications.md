    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this paper, we analyze the impact of the installation of indoor DAS on the global human exposure, considering both DL exposure, and UL exposure. Measurement campaigns are carried out with DAS on and off. The global exposure is evaluated using the ‘Exposure Index’ metric is analyzed. The results have shown that DAS implies a reduction in the global EMF exposure while improving the quality of network connectivity.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this paper, we present an approach to extrapolate the E field in an urban area using artificial neural network. Using public accessed datasets, i.e., cartoradio and OpenStreetMap, we then extract relevant features, including the ones that have a relation with the number of active antennas and those used by Bertoni-Walfisch propagation model.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this study, a statistical approach is utilized to characterize and model indoor RF-EMF DL exposure, where the variation of RF-EMF DL exposure is mainly influenced by the local indoor environment. Measurements were conducted in three buildings within a few hundred meters vicinity of two BS.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this work, we exploit the ANN model for the spatial reconstruction of RF-EMF exposure in an outdoor urban environment. Drive test measurement campaign was done to collect E-field strength information along the route. We compared the prediction performance using two ANN models.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this work, we conduct measurements in a multi-floor indoor environment using a handheld device, i.e., Nemo Handy, to record both DL and UL parameters for LTE networks. We build a feed-forward ANN model with RSRP, as input together with other parameters influencing the TX power and related to the measurement environment.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: We use stochastic geometry to explore the downlink exposure in 5G massive MIMO antenna networks. The distributions of antenna gain and channel gain were obtained by fitting simulation results, then implemented into an analytical framework. We obtained the closed-form expression of the MGF for the total exposure in the network and validate it by numerical simulations.

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: The time and spatial mapping of EMF exposure induced by outdoor BS using ANN are studied. The reconstructed EMF exposure map in urban environments is obtained by using data from EMF sensor networks, drive testing, and information accessible publicly, e.g., locations and orientations of BSA. We proposed a new efficient hybrid ANN structure and the results show it outperforms the conventional ANN.

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this work, we focus on spatially repulsive cellular networks and introduce a new parameterization for the IDT approach that is suitable for analysis of the Mean Interference-to-Signal Ratio (MISR). We prove that MISR, as well as the difference between the MISRs of Poisson and non-Poisson cellular networks, monotonically decreases as the PLE increases and the density of the BSs decreases.

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this work, we introduce an analytical framework for computing the distribution of the conditional coverage probability given the point process. Then, we have proved that the IDT approach for modeling and analyzing non-Poisson cellular networks can be successfully employed for studying the meta distribution. It is proved that these latter moments can be formulated in terms of a single integral expression. </li></ul>

    <ul><li><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em>: In this work, we introduce a new methodology for modeling and analyzing downlink cellular networks, where the BSs constitute a motion-invariant PP that exhibits some degree of interactions among the points, i.e., spatial repulsion or spatial clustering. The accuracy of the IDT approach is substantiated with the aid of empirical data for the spatial distribution of the BSs.
