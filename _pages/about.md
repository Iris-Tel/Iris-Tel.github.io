<h1> Bio </h1>	
<newline> 


<div align="justify">
<p>Shanshan Wang is an assistant professor (Enseignante Checheuse) at the Information, Communications and Imaging (ICI) group of ETIS (UMR8051, a joint research laboratory between CY Cergy Paris University, ENSEA and CNRS). She received her Ph.D. degree in from Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S), Paris-Saclay University, Paris, France in 2019. From 2015 to 2018, she was with the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Paris, as an Early Stage Researcher of the European-Funded Project H2020 ETN-5Gwireless. Her research interests include stochastic geometry, EMF exposure, energy efficiency, and machine learning for applications in wireless communications. 
From 2019 to 2023, she was a postdoctotal researcher in Télécom Paris, IP Paris, France. She was a recipient of the 2018 INISCOM Best Paper Award. She served as the guest editor of the MDPI Sensors in 2022.</p>

<!--- Site-wide configuration
 ------
 The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. -->

<!--- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.-->
